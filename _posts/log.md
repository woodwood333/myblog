that the website itself is a project, not to say an artpiece
maybe not from like technical oddities like webart stuff, but from elsewhere ? performance, theater, poetry, sculpture, idk

more a blog than a website, because nothing to sell, just to share

not 11ty but jekyl because easier, eventhough first encounter was with crabtree elevtee, but anyway, my website will not be what I was before, creating dans les regles de l'art with a craft work of website to back it up, not really my point anymore, or maybe not in one stroke but in the long run? 

feel like me as an artist exists only if website here to centralise and gather, allow for an overview, a reading of the practice brought to sight/to public existence. maybe it is more radical not to have such artistic existence, to exist only in the cracks, in the memory of people who were there, and maybe one day I'll feel confident enough, established enough, with enough of a concrete work not to have a website, not to have to share to be heard. 



lots of obscure zones in how it works, dealing with compiler and shit, way above my league
