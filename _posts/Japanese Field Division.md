## kyushu museum

for people here and also people back in france quickly sum up main important ideas, and atmosphere. 

These notes are based upon the visits of local actors of the ceramic industry and culture in Kyushu, Japan. They are manufacturers of all scale and style, museum curators and shop owner. Thanks them all for their generosity and dedication, and thanks to miki and yunohara for bringing us beyond the vitrine. 

The kyushu museum of ceramic draw our first glance to the world and history of japanese porcelain. We gradually got to know the entangled economical, political and geographical relations upon which this industry was built. If the oldest ceramics of the world can be traced back to japanese jomon era, it is not before 400 years ago that porcelain found its way from china to korea and japan eventually through the rapture of korean masters during Toyotomi Hideyoshi's violent invasion of south korea. In 1616, Yi Sam-pyeong or Kanage Sanbee stumble on what will later become the Izumiyama porcelain quarry, marking the beginning of the porcelain industry in Arita and Japan. Indeed, China for its style and Korea for its technic are commonly reffered to as the mother and father of japanses porcelain.

It appears that ceramic forms and decors emerge from local material and cultural specificities, but are also shaped by trademens importing foreign taste, scientists bringing more control over curves and brighter colors, craftmens and the overall style  and emperors definfing trends and the overall social organisation of the industry. Eventually tradition is a soft matter, it is all of a complex network of copies and innovation entangled in an already existing global market and ubiquitous game of influence. 

Instances of these oddities can trace history back. China started to nurtured japanese copies of its distnctive blue on white porcelain by selling the needed cobalt underglaze to japan. Then japanese potters copied chinese pottery instances in such a straightforward way that they also reproduced the "made in the great empire of china" signature stamp. Starting to trade with the west, Japan emulated latin serif typefaces on pots for the dutch market using japanese calligraphy brushes. Later, synthetic pigments developed in europe where used in japan with additifs to simulates the impurities of natural glaze rendering blinded colors more fitting the japanese taste. Eventually, a  japanese trademan imported european ceramic body, painted them in japan with the distinctive japanese style of japanese copy of western style, used in his western shaped house to promote japanese ceramics, copies or originals, to foreign trademan, shipping them back to europe, blurring the line between copy and original, traditional and influenced, western or eastern.

At first glance patterns seems unlimited, but looking closer I start to recognise some, and eventually get to know their name, their history and meaning. Some are drawn from other craft like textiles, some from nature, religion or daily life. We are expose to the different styles or ceramic traditions in kyushu ; kakiemon, nabeshima, karatsu, that will turn to be landstones in our navigation through japanese ceramic culture. 

# Day2

## Izumiyama quarry

Arita became Arita for three major reasons. The izumiyama quarry of course present at a walking distance but also the rivers for the mills crushing the rocks in powder and the forests providing the wood for the firings. The access to the quarry used to be strictly regulated through a licesing system. In fact, the whole city used to be enclosed and surveyed to preserve its precious knowhow.  Now, with its oddly serene atmosphere it appears  to be the favorite place of a lot of people in the city. After its exploitation for centuries, the mountain can rest a bit now since a better porcelain is extracted from Amakusa, a nearby city. In the surrounding, several monuments can be seen standing to praise or thanks the numerous anonymous workers and Kanage Sanbee. Severall of these monuments are spread accross the region but it feels doubtful, in some sort acknowledging the role and the influence of the korean people in  the development of japanese porcelaine with a certain form of nostalgia but somehow never mentionning the actual violence that led to this influence. 

## Arita folk & History Museum


A distinctive feature of Arita and the ceramic based cities of the region is the omnipresence of ceramic blending in the landscape, from electric plugs to doorknob, roof, wall and floor tiles, vases laying around overflowing with rain water, plants, stuff, boxes, pens, figurines, and everything in between. This also encompasses production leftovers and waste materials, from moulds stacked like mountains, porcelain pillows in river beds and of course the tombai gei, the walls built from ancient kiln bricks covered glazed from the ashes of hundreds of firings, and shards litteraly everywhaere on every strates of the ground as you can see in ground holes from street construction sites. More specifically next to each kiln are layers of discarded pieces whose study reveals the incremental evolution of shapes and technics. 

In the big anagama kiln, each room is allocated to a different potter company depending on their needs. What used to be huge shared kiln monitored by the region representatives later got split for more personnal kiln in order for the companies to gain control over their firing schedule and kilns became smaller and smaller as the potters practices individualised and unspecialised. The extra money earned from exportation to the west is partly spent on westen luxurious goods. 


## Saga Ceramics Research Laboratory

To me the Saga Ceramic Research and Laboratory seems one of the most relevant institution Arita could afford. What more supporting for a craft and an industry than a scientific laboratory dedicated to study the questions raised from its practice, troubleshoot the problems it faces, and market its ideas ? I particularely enjoy the use of  highly technical clay for 


# Day3

## Tajima-Shouten 
### clay factory

Here is processed procelain from rocks to clay. There is three grades of porcelain rocks in the amakusa quarry, layered from the top of the mountain and to the sea, each extracted by a distinct company. The top one, the purest, display the whitest shade. The second and third one contains impurities, mainly iron, that give the clay a dinstinctive creamy color and more plasticity. By combining these elements, Tajima shouten makes up its own recipes and provide the surrounding potter with local porcelain clay, the one we use at school. 

The process, that can take up to 3 weeks, consist of gathering, cleaning, milling, filtering, decanting, pressing and extruding. Relics of the former water powered apparatus can still be seen in the interstices of the building, soon replaced by electrical and automatised machinery. Only three people are needed to operate the factory, that consists in constantly tweaking the parameters of the machines in relation to the clay fluctuating characteristics. They also connect the different processing station by moving the material around. Du to a modest production, machines arent pushed to their limits and dont need much maintenance. The mill head, will eventually wear out and spoil the final product. It has thus been decided to use steel head, since as a ferrous and magnetic material, also naturally present in the clays, it is already planned to cure the bodies from it using a magnet. Because the purest the material the purest the waste, . The factory balances out between its different clay recipes so that waste from one recipe is transfered to nurture the qualities of another. Is thrashed only the iron, actually suitable for glazing but whose fluctuating quantity and quality makes it not fitting the standards requires for a further repurpose and commercialisation. The pressing technic uses a western technology maybe first developed in the wine industry. I also heard that some rocks used for grinding come from france, although the quality recently decreased and they are now considering egypt as a provider. 

The factories in themselves are a compact patchwork of heteroclite spaces, organically responding to centuries of transition, growth and crisis. It leaves little space in between  machines for operators to move around. The materials is moved to one station to the other using an ingenuous system of pipes and vacuume, the floor is clean where it could easily end up covered in mud, the pile of left overs are clearly delineated. It is left very clear what each station deos and how it does it since there is no or little electronic involved in the machines. The processing sequence is clear and fluid although the frontiere between the exterior and the interior is blurred by machines in the outside. Office jobs are done in a room separated from dusts, noises and view with a partition wall.

## Fukutoshi-kiji
### raw product making factory

The company specialised in raw product manufacturing, leaving firing and other task to  other specialised factories. The dried pieces are transported by a truck driver also specialised in raw product transportation, and is considered a master in his domain. The road need to be well maintained for the commercial life of the region.

Crowded, busy with precise tasks, moving the materials around, it is not suited for visitors and is easy to be a burden for the workers. In a corner are intriguing and familiar little donut shape and mug bodies. They are muji product ! The toothbrush holder and mug from the bigger client of the company. Although, we learn from the owner, a young guys wearing military t shirts and cargo pants, that they keep its order rate under 40% of their total income. It is not rare that companies here entirely depends on the the japanese giant, going bankrupt when it goes away to some cheaper chinese factory. They are tough clients, with high standards and low the prices, beside not acknowledging the recent rise of electricity and material costs. Although it is nice to see how a small factory can be a part of the bigger network of such a widely distributed product as mujis tableware can be, in other words, how 20 focused and specialised individuals can produce goods for the whole planet. It is also nice to see Miki joyfully interracting with everyone eventhough we cant understand a word of what exactly is being said. 


## Tagawa-sekkou
## model and mold making factory

Warm jazz cracks on the radio and everyone works silently as we enter the tiny workshop, we barely introduce ourselves and start watching the delicate mold making process. It truly is the realm of perfection as each mistake would be passed on hundred if not thousands of times, from model to mold to mother mold to mold again to product eventually. We see the master at work, working on his tiny crowded desks to some silicon part for a complex ornemented coffee filter model. He get to use his custom silicon mallet, stating that with molds and silicon, everything is at reach. 


## Imaemon-gama
### Traditional pottery

We are welcome to wait in the showcase room where the most magnificient pieces are display in a decorum of thick vermeil carpet floor, deep navy velvet walls and dark wood shelves. The Imaemon arrives, discusses calmy with our teacher and eventually look at us as we are being presented. He is dressed in a costume pants, black loafer, and mixed eastern and western jacket upon a thick textured white shirt converying a very serene look and delicate hand gestures. He present us to his work, the technics involved, the history of each piece and pattern. Two generation ago, his father started to develop a more unique voice rather than strictly following a tradition. And so he perpetuates this approach by developing new original ideas in his work, that display very complex layers of overlapping patterns and technics, luxurious platinium luster and subtle wax resist drawing of white glaze on white body. 

I ask about how he develops such graphics. He explains how he skip study drawing because for how it doesnt reflect the effect of drawing on volumes, and that it is for this reason that he works on the pot directly. He brings us to his workshop on the second floor rhrough a narrow staircase enclosed with shelves overflowing with art and craft books from every period and region, some french title here and there. His workhop, a small room built around a desk on the left and an estrade in front, resemble more a living room or a writers office than a potters workshop. There is indeed very few tools. We get rid of our shoes, just to stay on the threshold as there is not much else to go. There he shows us an image of a paperwall in which he likes the rendering of depth and then demonstrate how he work, drawing with ample movements on a generous bisque fired pot,  with very light charcoal chalks, drawing on gently erasing with a duster when needed. He gets his inspiration from nature, his emotions, and the books, the tradition. It is a very precious moment to witness and Mikki emphasiszed later how lucky we actually were, as she never had been allowed upstairs before. 

After he develop the design, a whole team of highly skilled craft dedicate themselves to the reproduction of his models. Downstair, Pots are thrown, the surface is carefully damped and smoothen to ease the painting job. Upstair, aligned in front of the so called window displaying a soft and bright light, are the painter at work. Again we get rid of our shoes, the wooden floor is clean like new, and not a sound is to be heard. The working clothes looks more like elegant silk pajamas than workers uniforms. Chalk models are lighlty printed on the pots but serves just as common grounds for the painter more akin to interpretation, following their inner line. Despite the extremely high price of the pieces and the originality of the designs, he likes to call himself a craftman, making functionnal object, always taking into account the setting and need of the final user, that he cherish.
 


## Fukuju-gama 
### pottery


Despite their simplicity and casual atmosphere, the production from FukujuGama are very carefully crafted. Otherwise left for cheaper product, they add production value by carefully chosing third grade porcelain and thick glazes that meet the visual qualities wished for of warmth and sturdyness inspired from ancient styles of dishes mixed with fresh and cute graphics. The technical restriction of a time made created visual qualities now recognise as a style. 

The company work from wholesale production orders, also developing inhouse designs. But the level of standardisation (we are not talking quality here) are very high, leading some pieces to the waste bin because of such invisble deffect, or features, like unoticible dents or glaze pinhole. which seems to us quite irrelevant as we jump inito the waste bin, leaving with shoju special cup for me and a comic dragon self standing soup spoon for janneke. 


## Arita Sera

We enter a long, wide unique avenue bordered by short in height but profound shops. They are whole sale companies gathering the production of local factories and potters. Historic pieces and modern production cohabit of various grades, influences, shapes and function, but mainly tableware. Demands for arita ware fluctuates throuhout history with high and low demand period. Right now the demand is low for traditional memorabilia ware so momotoa touen decided to launch the 1616 project to, once again, gather international designer to meet international market for evolving arita ware tradition. It has been decided to turn this place from a mere shopping alley to a more globale and important sight seeing spot of the region, adding cultural events, bars and restaurants during the summer period. I felt a bit awkward surrounded by this huge amount, with only few visitors made be doubt about the relevance of such a production. Ironically most of the things I liked were foreign designs, which questioned the relevance of my criterias when it come to assess things.

## Fukagawa Seiji

The tour is well done, and facilities paced our path, mediated with props, it quickly appears that we are not the first one to sight see the place. At teh first floor, a intimate room like a western salon, arranged around a big wooden table , and blue on white vases all around each bearing a different name. Pictures are allowed, and we also are presented a book about the presence of teh manufacture vases at the !1900 paris exposition universelle, followed by an essay from art historian sonia coman about the self referentiality mechanism showcased by the japanese aesthetic of decoration since centruies before it became one of the core concept of the european modernist movement. Then we enter the private showroom where teh most iconi and historicaly relevant pieces of teh company are displayed on podium behind glasses in a museum manner. pictures are not allowed. Hre we understand the importance of the company, who produced set among t he most well crafted of japan, for teh emperor, teh Great Britain Royal familiy aomng others it is often a matter of diplomacy and acronically soft power underground.

In the main workshop the ceiling is low and teh fixtures are hanging even lower, as always, the place is extremely dense, shelves, pots, working station everwhere, and the owner encourage us to take pictures of the virtuose glazing technic consisting at throwing pieces in a bassin of glaze, let it float and rotate in one go and pick it up. Here everything is handthrown, without sketches, inspired from the infinite past models crowding some shelves in the background. The trimming process is presented as extremely important since it scraps off the last grams that makes the japanese tableware so confortable to lift up and handle as eating, different than the western style where heavy wide low profile plates are standing very stabily on the table. We witness a bulky soucoup turned into a delicate lid through the trimming process. Eventually he present imself as the maestro of this orchestra and we come back to the public showroom to admire the commercialized pieces with an informed gaze. 


## Urabe

In a more rural and decontracted setting, we are welcomed maskless with a nice smile the two young sisters of the urabe factory. Selfteached by their surrounding the principle of casting, the raw material company focuses on modern pieces like coffee filter and modern tableware. It is nice to see young, girl owner working incorporating  technical twist in simple pieces, like using the local q shock porcelaine, besides more experimental projects like working with dutch designer in a residency type of setting, to upcycle waste of production and processes, and more personnal handpainted pieces in a naive and playful style. Happily for us it is soon break time and we have a nice coffee. The place reflect the calm, and fresh personnality of the owners and is really the atmosphre I want to work in or create later.


## Hakusan Porcelain

On a totally different mood here is the famous hakusan manufacture which produce industrial, modern porcelain ware for the daily use. It has an inhouse design department where prototypes are made from commercial brief in direct relation with the technical facilities. Everything is developed inhouse, from the design to the glaze recipes and clay body. The design department is a white space where a full wall shelved display white prototypes. The senior designer is concentrated on the making of a model on the plaster wheel and doesnt notice our presence behind the glass. Here, the visit is not official and pictures are prohibited as well as the mention of this visit. The factory is housed by a former school. Bodies are machine made while decorations are done by hand to give a special atmosphere. The glazing area is left away as the process are kept secret, which almost feel oldschool. The atmosphere is more serious than in urabe, without the sense of wonder present in luxurious ware factories. Here the designs are simple, the thickness is reasonable and foster durability over delicacy. The sober and generic designs make them suitable for any home. It is a good representation of the industry. The famous masahiro mori designs are thoughtful and straightforward, which can be touching but they sometimes feel slighty superfluous to me, when their function is so precise, or narrow, as can be a vase designed to fit in corners.

## okawachiyama

From the enclosed village of okawachiyama, village of the secret kiln, or hidden village of potters as displayd by the signroad,  we understand that back then, surrounded by mountain with a sole road leading to the place, locked by a gate, potery masters where enforced to work at the production of the shogun vessel. Some potters died falling from the mountains as they climbed to escape. It is important to remember that pottery spans from grandma hobby to industry work and forced labour. 


## Hataman

Despite a discrete exterior appearance, the tiny shop is supported by a surprisingly sized workshop and a neat and modern painting room. Crancked over their desk, the painters stay still, linked to the stable furniture by  a whole range of custom foam supports to stabilize their gestures. A droplet shaped steamer slows down the drying process by diffusing a warm and humid atmosphere. Intricate patterns are handled with care, plates are hold and tilted to lead the pigment to flow in the wished direction into the porous bisque.  Painting curiously appear to be the best way to get intimate with the topology of a pots, as color and patterns, images and signs are deployed on the curved surface. 

Eventually we are offered a cup of tea and coffee as our hosts fade out to help other clients and we are left on a beautiful XIX western style table cloth, enjoying the precious pieces from the manufacture. Throughout the day it will indeed become clearer to me that in the end the most enjoyable part of porcelain really is to gather people around and eat and drink together. 


## Sakurei

After a long ride through the autumnal mountain scenery a small alley lead to the small heave of traditional karatsu style sakurei house and pottery studio. Rocks and clay and shells are drying under the sun on rice straws matts in the entrance courtyard. Enjoying the tea ceremony, we are told to relax ! The wagashi are amazing, the wood saucer combined with the local ceramic cups and iron kettle on a old wood from the weight of a water mill, water coming straight from the mountain, the homemade bean tea and macha and the personnality of sakurei san make this moment very precious. Beside of this he is the first one acknowledging that 5  months is a very very short period of time to discover a country and a craft. We can nothing but hardly agree. He presents his kiln, fired every two month, which represent an insane amount of work for one person to fill it up. Indeed he doesnt take hollidays and confess not sleeping much neither. I wonder what precisely established this pace. 

It is funny to notice the contrast of the karatsu tradition with the imari ware. In one case, workers spend years specialising in a single task, and the production is splitted among specialised workers and companies, enabling the production of flawless intricate shapes and decoration, and on the other hand, individual potters taking charge of every steps leading to rougher designs. Both styles developed without any hybridation while developed at a few kilometers only from each other. Karatsu yaki reflect the ceramic production of japan before the importation of korean potters and porcelain technology, with a different social division of labour.

We stop by a great sushi restaurant, the smell, the wasabi, the pickled ginger the salmon, the clear broth, the unboned fish, every thing is amazing and subtle and it is a delight to enjoy this talking with yunohara and mikki sensei about japanese food and ceramic culture. 


## Touraemon

And the last visit somehow... 
In the showroom I understand how I relate to karatsu, its simple getsures of throwing and altering that I like, and simple ornementation techniques like stamp, inlay and slip brushing. A special room display special pieces, where the Touraemon th 4th is displayed nearby his father touraemon the 3rd, national living treasure. Scenery of fish, deeply carved in generous tea ceremony water container of various shapes somethime coated in bright turquoise colors or the three colors of karatsu ware. The museum has recently beenbuilt in a modern style inside an ancient house. It revolve around a massive table sometime used for dinner organised with guest chefs from all over the world. Beautiful pieces are displays here and there.  The touraemon present us the work of his apprentice, a mysterious uk-japanese guy who learned the craft in only 2 years. I notice a beautiful set of cup and saucer in very thin ceramic and matt rugged red glaze he made during his short apprenticeship. No pressure !Another tiny museum composed of a unique room housed by a garden shed displays old pieces from before porcelain took over japan, more than 400 years ago, that his father colletionned before giving it to the city of karatsu, and then rented back for the little musuem. 

We wander around in the maze of his workshops, crossing a street, opening doors, walking along alleys, cimbing up old kilns moe or less in use and abandonned workshops left with kickwheel laying around and sone portrait of his forebears. It is all not in use anymore. Indeed, the facilities consist of several buildings, the showroom but also a museum, several workshops and kilns, forming a conglomerate of little house discretely spreading along unrelated houses.

Apparently his son, that we witness barefoot wedging some huge lamp of clay, in the back of a workshop, crossed japan from tokyo to karatsu by feet. It took him 3 months, Mikki thinks its stupdid, I think its great and congratulate him. He seems like a funny guy as he reply, gambare ! We then see a guy, that look like everything but a throwing wheel master, dancing around a korean kickwheel. The set of tools reduced to its minimum, a water jar, leather and rope, makes it beautiful to see.The kickweel, slightly off centered, increasing with speed, and quite light, meaning it needs almost constant action, makes it impossible to have perfectly rigorous cylinder and makes the peculiar atmosphere of karatsu ware. We conclude this meeting with some pictures with the touraemon, my jaws hurting as I smiled so much, and him to say the last words, dont forget.

I am wondering what if I do study under him for 2 years, dwelling in the guesthouse (the guy has a modern castle for a house, no joke) and learning japanese. 



## Tips and Tricks
https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/single-firing-should-you-do-it-4091999

As water will leave the clay during the firing process, you need to make sure the clay is as dry as possible before you put the glaze on. Some potters recommend leaving the clay to dry to a bone dry level before glazing, as leather hard pieces still carry quite a high level of water content. If you are going to try the single firing method, then you’ll have to be a bit of an expert on [glazes](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/ceramics-glazes-for-beginners-4134618).

One of the most important factors is that the glaze should contain a high clay content. The reason the glaze should have a high clay content is that the raw piece will be rehydrated by the materials in the glaze and can swell, and if there is not enough clay in the glaze recipe then it can flake off.

Shiny glazes are very tricky to use for a single firing as they often have a lower clay content. Some potters use a spray glazing technique to minimize the amount of water being absorbed into the clay. This method also reduces how much you will have to handle the ceramic ware.


# Afra exhibition

smart scarce display apparatus
nice that she actually made lots of friends, and collaborted with lot of peoples, daring to ask, to pay, to get teached, not searching to do everything, as arita every production is a collaboration she did the same.
