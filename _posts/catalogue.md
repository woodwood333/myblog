sum up

just with dm, but clear
low tech

about / 
because there is a thousand way to be a potter, i wanted to be the 1001. This batch is made from amakusa porcelain and glaze recipes from japan, if it adds value to your eyes. 

The clay bodies will change depedning on where I am, but it will always be porcelain.

some pieces are once fired, some are fired 3 times to get them correct.
some are using home brew glaze recipes from local rocks, supermarket or off the shelves. 

im a professional potter since you pay for my potteres, although they might be not perfect, dont expect perfect, it is not that imperfection are part of the design, it is that each cup is frezing a moment in time.

Each piece freeze


I had the opportunity to study ceramic for a semester in japan and this is the result of my research/of what I found.?did/

I focused on what it could mean to be a potter today, and what potters exactly do.  

I specialised on the throwing wheel because it is emblematic from the potter idea, and bcaus eit seemd like a rich technic to unravel. 

because I dont have anything fixated yet and every piece is a prototype for the next one and the wheels allows this. 


The typology of product is drawn both from the very pieces I use in my life and some additions from the classics instances of studio pottery average pieces like the jug or the vase. 


You can pick your orders up in paris, france and eindhoven, the netherland. 




Custom orders. 

bradning is a good exercize in summurize. ai ? 

can i have amakusan porcelain back in france ? 


colophon, for website, and pottery


more like a catalogue documenting the evolution and mutation of the pots, presenting every mug ever sold


also trhe website acknowledge the idea that object and commodities can be worth and valued and consumed without actually monetary exchange through the ritual act of buying but just by the knowledge of its existence, the idea it holds, as a discoure, as an idea, and its accessibility through its image and metatext. therefore, the archive of the studio catalog is displayed along the currently available pieces. 

it migt be pretetntious to think that oall of this mise en scene would push you to relate and appreciate our brand and therfore pushes you to buy it, but remember of these mechanism when clicking the purchase button, and buying can be an act of support more than an act of consumption, like a recompense from the support. also, the studio is open to trade proposition of other than monetary exchaneg, just reach out ;)

shared through the as ritualistic act of promotion how you ened up there. 

more a studio or me a potter ? me a potter with a potential of aggreggating other people as a studio. or collective.
