Intangible sculpture

I decided to call sculpture this thing created by my reaction to what happens. 

I think of sculptures, existing in skulls, where is felt what is felt. They would be made from what occures and shaped by how it is perceived/reaction. 

A world made of occurances, charged. Our world made of interaction, affected. We make/change/need them and they make/change/need us. In the end we are one. 

Sculptures are, just before, in skulls, where is felt what is felt, where are explored the forms and beauty of interaction and hallucinated what happen elsewhere. 

Listening an album ; listening what is said, listening what is heard, opening the door to what is said that can't be heard ; looking at what is built in between. 

and where it goes. 
from where it comes from, 
what it does. 

mind loop

Meeting someone ; how you feel 
It is so people  radiate something, like a hard smell, that imbues in my gestures, 

Being someone ;



Discuting ;




progression from page to page, differences build up, 


looking at an oriental carpet, or to foliages in the sky, until hallucination, until it becomes a mirror
