Textland is an exhibition that document and share the development of a writing practice, seen as a personal strategy to cope with the textual chaos and information overload sometime experienced. 

Its central piece is an extensive panel of notes taken throughout the elaboration of the project, that retrace its genealogy. These notes display the layout strategies prototyped to facilitate a sustainable and informative log-journaling practice. Their content is mostly reflexive, disserting on the nature of writing and reading, exploring methods of textual genetic and knowledge management, but also contain personal stories and check-ins. It is tried, through them, to articulate, and to escape second hand sources and level of content for more empirical one. The subject is pushed to the limits of mystical realm and hallucination.

Textland as an exhibition displays various text work and experimentation; translations, repetitive reading, printing, publications along case studies of textual instances.

The display apparatus itself is seen as a a piece of the exhibition, seeping in, as a reflection on the act of display, a new layer to to the aesthetic of knowledge evocated and the relation between the object that support the not so disembodied realm of ideas.  

Ultimately luring to the realm of personal archives, Textland tries to grasp a certain feeling of our information civilisational and organisational mind, and outline some points of crispation. 

### v3


Textland aims to lay the foundation, and clearing the path, and a space for, a writing practice, and a symbiotic, complementary embryon of experimental publishing entity,. 
it was the place of the development of a set of specific skills, from the most imprtant that touch typing, but also editing job and editorial design, 
also see the adoption of a highly curated set of digital tools
it also was the place for the dev of a certain acquaintance and sensibility for texts in its different occurance and forms, ge got closer, more intimate to texts, easier to help people edit. 
development of certain theory of writing and reading, particularly acknowldging the influence of the material world on texts and ideas, as well of it from the mystical world. 
lay down the different level of formating, from notes, to mail and full proof edited and shared.

eventually dispays a collection of fragments and impressions of the above, a recollection from the experience of being submerge in words. 

dev of layout strategies for lo and journaling activities and relevant raphic vocabulary.

## v4



discovering my sensibility, through the making actually, through everything else, but nurtured by the writting I think, being closer, and paing closer attention to what I feel and how I feel. thats one of the things the proejct, or not the projcet really, that is the fictional and and articulated and presented institutionalised version of the framed version of the activities and feeling I have during this frame of time. 

its about thinking about thinking, criticasizing it but having nothing else to do than keep doing it, or critisizing from the same place than whats critisized.  ðŸŽ•ðŸ—˜ knowing the limits of the frame, but not knowing how to escape from it ?


##final 
invitation to find ways around the systems, get closer to texts not fearing intensity, and articulate.

## tabletop

Here is a picture of my working environment. I took it show that im doing something, to show a proof of work and skills. But when i look at it, it is still hard for me to see skill in it, in that i dont see skill in a piece of paper, as eautifully arranged with as many letters on it. And I don't see skill in some craft in some letters this time arranged in line line behind the screen of a computer. 

are work memories linked to certain settings, to certin tabletops ?

## Behind the line is the paper 

I put it next to the wikipedia article of research, to show that although the nature of what is going on here, behind these lines of text, behind this image of research, of depth, is hard to grasp, very abstract, and behind these lines of text seen in the picture, is nothing but this very picture. 

## a thousand link

of course there is more, and these lines of writings can be seen as connecte by an infinite number of extremely thin silk link to all the things they represents, they evokes, and the channel they take, these links of silk going in people tongue, relvolving around their tongue, bumping into their teeth, echoign in the palais, and vibrating ramping through the laryinx and around, slowed by th e mooisture of the throat and to the stomach, ciruclating in their veins and out to their hands and the things they touch, the mug and the rim of the mug when they burn themselves back to the mout and through the skull, the ears, the bone of the ears to the bone of their dog and the book they look, the letters the riead and back to the bone of thei jaws to pronounce this diffecult nam, difficult because not seen often in their child. 
all of this is linked by a thousand of silk link softly sparkling. 

## journaling goes wrong, honnest version

Soo many cnversational issues, my talks are paved with red flags, just always brought back to talking to myself because trying to figure something out with whoever, not trusting their ability to help me, not actively expecting help from them, but just a receptcal, when it was not to impress them.  adn  when they would talk, not knowing, not asking awht they exocected from me, and my attention jsut used their words, not what they were saying, bumps into personnal buzzword with no a little regard to the context, thtat trigger the geared in head trigger the machine and  get back ;inside of my head to process some unprocessed thought or repetiting some obessional stuff, evertyinh but actively listening to the person. 

On the other hand, the log, was there as a witness of the path and geneaolgy of a project, and buiilding knowledge step by step, little story and paragraph 

Everytime i would talk to someon
to ease my mind is why I started journaling, to empty my head to clean it form the pollution that blinded me and disconnected me from my friends, but i was logging on the side, and 


whats up guys hello in this new video about making a super journaling method. you can take start with an a4 because its big enough to then redivise it depending on uou needs and usage. you can then hum do your tings and start 

expaining my example and then how to do the same ?

so here is my layout, 
its on a4 because i will then further edit teh format. and I start with lll

## yesterday before today before tommorrow

I like the arbitrarytyryness of chornological classification, it seems, like little culturei sinvolved, at lesast less than within highly elaborated idesytem of indez and controlled vocabulary way less spatial and more subjective , partial

## approaching the exhibition

It feel wrongto em c to make such object that only make sense in the temporary artificial  an dmore or less fictional space and time of an exhibition. When the show ends, the masterpiec eimmediatly into bulky and irreleveant objects, a burden to transport and store. In the other hand why not. I can now think of 2 strategies : that of making thr exhibition space less temporary , artificial and fictional, and that of acknowledfing the temporal, artificial and fictional aspect of every setting.

## thought control

I want a thought that does not really fix a, a nd close things and topic, abut rather one, fruitful, that opens, wonder, maybe clear certain opaque patj, but never shuts down. 
I want to think in positivity as well as negativity. 

## writing to discuss, open writing, for open discussion

Also, paradoxically, I feell that writing are a good buffer zone,  mediator that fozes ideas downs, but in the same gesture, make them accessible to discussions, giving people interested the time and adistance to react. I dont need an heavy institution and program of feedback and exchange, infirmal will do for now. 

## dooubtful

Eventhough I am very doubtful of a lot of things, especially concerning what I do, th default mode of my deep and instinctive brain is not doubt. I have as a proof that I don' doubt about my doubt. 

questioning our engagement is reaffirming one's will to be happy at it.

## queer privacy

is there such a thing called queer privacy, that would be for hiding what the norms want to know and sharing what they want to hide ?

emotional intelligence, maturity, and active listening

Indeed, nailing intimacy, through wirtting and shame I discovered I had an intimacy, an intimatelife, mostlry connected to mathild and the mirror to thats in the open air bub that only repetition and acquaintance adistinguished. \the question now is that relevance of the feeling of shame, whether is is rights, where it belings if in the contrary shouldn't be, should be challenged. 


## not being mediocre

paraphrase to be sure you understood, and maybe offer a mirror to the person sayings. SHOW empathy, offer to find a solution together, ask what is expected from you, or what you could do to help, dont get defensive or heated, dont be mediocre, oversee the situation, take some hieght. dont critisize, in the first place, dont minimize or  invalidate their emotion, validate them on the contrary.

## reading exercize

open all the doors of your heart, of your body, if something hinder you or affect you, let it flow inside dont obstruct, dont justify, dont critisize or mute or block, but listen, let open inside, try to read closer, to undrstand closer

the other way, close everything, everything is bullshit for some reason, liberate the interior dialogue, make it flow over the flaws you see, every word rengorce the disagreement and make you stronger. 

try to think, what is the relation between the text written and the idead catched  and mentionned and developed ?

a study can be consider of paper and printer parallel development and influence, and books, forms of printing and paper and ink ?

## inside the printer

Its nice to open up the cover to see the head at works and the paper moving. I wanat to be intimate with my printer, that see a lot of what I write, but Epson instit;ytion is in the way, the global market is in the guts of my beloved printer, precenting me to fix it, to get intimate withit, to allow it to chang me ini return. 

There is an ink and paper interraction tha I can foster, the dotted and plain surface, moist and wrnkling, the paper pressed sensually leaving faint traces on the paper. by the feeding gears.

## In praise of patches

I recently found a new affection for theve patches stratey of proablem solving. I use to reconsiderata global politic and human nature when tackling small issues. EX It is a nice mind trick to experience and not even so far from a certain reality, but alo out of erach and ultimatally paralysinfg or irrelevant if not pretentious. Patces I find them cure. They are the problem solving tool of people who dont know about porbkem solving who dont& problem solve for a living directly, who are not asked to at least who haven't been teache to , sho can'g  even think if changing the context or paracigm, but just need their actual issue pointed because they n up themselves) out on the long term thtough repetition practice to be fixed or improvedl They can witness if the global context and our current be seen as position and power. They are small and cure and meaningfull and effective and harmless and frank and smart.


## japan beyond words.

I never had such and epxerience thn Japan, that was so intense emotionally without words, I am so laconic when it comes to Japaon, even toughless, idea free, just a big load of disarticulated, unidfied nonetheless sensation impression feeling gounde deep behind my eyes, back in my flesh, inth this strange place behind , in time, around, like a dream, a very ancient dream.


## vim

## talking to my computer

I directly wanted to know how they worked, how programs got executed. Then I wanted to know how to do to write programs at more and more intimate level of the computer. 

## learning to touch type
 - using more tha 20% of the feature of a keyboard, demystigying it, makig sense of the layout, acknowledging differences in layout and therefore cultural differences and linguistifr 
 - the interface with digital, easing all processes feeling acquainted look the computer in the eye/scrren when writing, 
 - the pleasure of the crafrt it represet, or the instrument the body and mental experiene, the concentration, the practice, the mindframe of doctors
 - funny to do now with ai and voice typing and such, almost participative archaeology, experimental, anachronic
 - the communicty, practiotioners, whu do some people leardm, and master it_ online pedagogies, dissensus, tutorials, retex,e tc
 - everything i am doing right now, i could have not even imagined doing a quarter of it if I didnt learned to touch type, copying texte if you have to look at the paper, then the keyboard, then the screen, would have take age beside probably being an horrible and dizyness mishap


## write and rewrite

Its not a problem in . these notes to weite and rewrite stuff, it is not about copu pastin the perfect text, not about form ,but about content, about the very act oof writing, again and again. Its about developing a practice and ideas, about repeating, about articulating. 


## grey litterature

## shared intimacy

Yesterday i didn't even feel thisu sual frustration, and jalousy, didn+7t even think of it. I almost didn't wrute it. Why is it that  thath soeitme the most imporan is relaf\gated to the edh\ge of what is worhtwile, even exist, barely noticed ? Rethinking the intimate. The tiny discussion I had with Cgarlene and how open she is about ger dream is great... We the intimty of a lot of person, kinda look the same. 
also it is often that these days, understanding that you do sometihing or dont, because of fear, doubt and insecurities, the best thing do do, and the straongest, is actually to share this doubt. which seem simple and obvious, but weve so been trained to hide these, to think we have to come with solution and statement and such. but there is a value in sharing doubt, first honnesty, second, because its shared. although doubt is worth it only if it doenst mean stopping searching. like the imerfection in the bowls that are only beatiful if they come from the process and trying to get a perfect bowl. 


## judging books

legibility and conciseness, efficience in the information transmission aren't universal rules every book should fall under when it is not friven by carelessness at least. 

## yet better feedback

- situate the feedback from where it comes, its limits and consequences
- balance the goog and the bad, there is no perfect project nor hopeless one. 
- think twice the intent of every word that comes out of your mouth, dont project, try to impress, speak for yourself.
- react on whats there as well as onwhay&s missing. positivy and negativity
- propose alternative, open up possibilities, 
- ask what you can do to help, what is expected from you
- speak from inside and outside perspective share emitiona and also listen !
- try to share your opinion, your values, but if not received, it is not a fight, you are here to help, so go in their direction as well.

## counter factual history

counter factual history draws historical conclusion and hypothesis out of facts that could ve happen. It tells more about the present than the past. In fact, it showcase the present influene the past as much as the past the present. 

## handwriting exceptionality, normal day


These days I'm thinking of getting back to obsidian, becauseo f the openness it proposes. counter fatual here could have open a nnew window easer to refer to) I could create an ana;og zettelkasten shelf system but why bother ? Anyway it starts to be obvious that handrwriting is exceptional when it come to be done, bu illegible when it comes to be used, shared, edited.  But its going to be complicated to have something so convenient to do and aestitic and original in its output on the computer. Layout, writing, drawings, phusicality). Although its food to notice that so far I kept omy vad habits and I havnet sorted my pages that still piles up mutedly. Also I havent really used all the `information`  held in the manuscropt (its history, the life\work balance) are they so valuable or do they just convey a feeling of sweat and tear when it comes to thinking through and workig hard that is a bit regressive and childish to staged like that ?ã€€What i like in the difital is the inherent discrepancy between form and content, stored differently, using differnt syntax.

## cringe
I often cringe these situation where a first contact with someone is never continued, floating... I feel like I own someone something... Eventhough i now know that it's better to go back without a gift than to wait for a gift and never come back.

Writing around the line, sometime the point is always outside of the text, somewhere else. 
Im always a witness of the letter I draw and the sense or lack of sense sI unravel. 
Ajf the writing are bad, what matteris the experiene, and the faith that something will open up and shed light somehow crack open 
so im documenting this process, and keeoping the traces of it, the manuscript.

## there is always something to write

the manuscript is such a good companion. 

REading as close as sharply that you start to halluvinate, and rad behing the lines,  that you start to see text on a blank page and meaning in a curve and a stroke, that writing and getting as as your heart that word melt down to reveal what tinted as they are, were hiding, what they mean and you start articulating this matter and write without words.

## layout lessons

- line lenght depending on the style of the writing, that therefore should be consistent throuhout the text. 
- typographic grey depend on leading and typeface choice  and should match the general tone of the book gay or sad, light or heavy, easy or dificult
- fix the rivers in the text body by playig with tracking and kerning, ultimately with detail like minimum and maximum space in justification settings. 
- the reading condition lead the size, 6-8 for intimate reading experience, easy texts and 9-12 for more difficult text, to study on a table, and higher changes the relation with the body, more specific case .

## corrugaetd crust and rounded pie slice

I's nice, it happens that I brought back some shells for pots, from trouville. I went ti trouvilles because I was tired from berlin, and I went to Berlin because I was tired from school. Also because I wanted to enjoy my friend in Berin, Mathilde in Trouvills. It wasn't planed , I just remembered people using them in Japan and so decided to try it up  myself back in eindhove and p. I just saw in these shells the ceramic posssibilities, i jusst remembered japans and som ebowls recognised in the familiar corrugated crust and roundedpie slice shape of shells , aeach of japan, the imprints on these the glaze of some bowls I saw in japan thatI recognised in these shells. \and so I decided to pick some up.

It bring me joy to be back in eindhoen, that I left to go in Troub\ville, veause I was sad, where I found the shells to bring bsack, to go back in einfhoven.  

All these writings, these strokes are time glued no the paper, from the pressure ont he graphite binded on the mine stufk in the irregularities of the paper, between the fibers that interwoven, make a surface, the flat surfae called paper.

2 relation to speaking out

I don't tak much space. In my family when around the table, to eat we don't hear much. The conversation when occuring, might seem a bit daunted, poussive, exhausting, asking a lot of effort. In some families effort are put in trying to discernate who said what n the brouhaha  in mine it is exhausted effort to bring few mumble out ofour mouths, to keep the meal alive, to glue a bit the parts of this family., 4 different humans. Eventhugh my father is a salesman and know how to get chatty with client, with his child its seems different, not so easy. sometime I hate my parents for having seemingly nothing to say. 

And now I'm with Mathilde, who used to figth to speak at dinners and get heard, who can keep talking until someone need to  answer and with whom I feel muter and locked, frozen inside somehow.

about #touchtyping i can say two things, first the text written when colisng my eyes, the first time, and the keyboard dependant based grammar (typos) it generated, and secondly, that the [[Paper Booklet#digression]]

	halala obsidian is a great tool hihihi happy to be back 

	im probably currently polutting my #touchtyping hashtag hihi

was the first oocurance of this moment of flow typing a text on the computer, where i could wirte almost as fast as i thought, oot at least that the speed of my writting wasnt so mch of a buredn to follow my thoughts. , enable me to keep track, and making the text quite ast and natural to write, giving me courage and confidence for the writing of the booklet. but then i also weite way more anecodtic stuff and badly phrased sentences. making for low contetnt writing. 

t is also such a pleasrue to touch type, like playing the guitar. that you then stick to the computer, and also give for a very different writing experience and therefore content. its crazy to think of this, that writing is an embodied experience, and that therefore the tool used and the sisposition influence the text, ultimately the ideas ? virgina woolf being in the first that i can think of that gavea brillant report of this fact.

When I think of all these houses I inhabited for yeats beraing the traces of all their succesive use, annd all these objects that I kept discovering until te last days before my departure.

## project

from ted nelsons, experience, talking of evsilly thierything as a project is sad in that everything cant be finished, but how to call or see, or think of , refer to  or experience as, if not a beginning of a proeject, silly things one does(talking with Klara about that)  its a bit sad because thses are then thought of as unfinished, which , in our societies, is kinda sad while it could hacve been, what, what is it, a note, an unfinished writting, a never read back piece of text ??

the project is also about unfinished stuff right ? fragment ? but when to call something finite ? in the end do we know ? 
its kinda funny to end with ted nelson. the failure of classification, the infinte of never finished projects. 

something pathetic

https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu

Â Nelson, with his unfocused energy, his tiny attention span, his omnivorous fascination with trivia, and his commitment to recording incidents whose meaning he will never analyze, is the human embodiment of the information explosion.


Nelson explained that he never succeeded as a filmmaker or businessman because "the first step to anything I ever wanted to do wasÂ [Xanadu](https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/#2)."

Tormented by his own faulty memory, Nelson developed the habit of asserting that only a technology for the preservation of all knowledge could prevent the destruction of life on Earth. The thought that some mental connection or relationship might dissolve was unbearable. Not only was the constant churn and dispersal of his own thoughts personally devastating, but the general human failure to remember was, Nelson thought, suicidal on a global scale, for it condemned humanity to an irrational repetition of its mistakes.

## porosity as an object state
I've always tried to have object with a certain porosity, a sense of unfinitedness, catch in a stage of transition, ready to be altered again, never assuming their finiteness, their perfection, not so solid, im talking about my bowls that were unglazed, or considering themin relation to their backdrop, or with the table, for the text, im talkin about not justifying them, or printing everything out on journal binding.
it all always continue

the point of the exhibition, on an objective level is dealing with information overflow, on another level it is just taking notes trying to read and write the world, and documenting the process to share we are all in the process, pathetic but thats the only thing to do or that make sense somehow, shasring this. its like ted nelson kept thinking he couls save the world,, we know we can only by keeping trying, because the value is in the process of as always no ? anyway, just printed th e first version of the book and Im happy, it really start to be good. 

## just notes
they could tell me, you just gathered you thoughts and notes in a book wtf everyone could do that, but no, because they dont, and i do, and these notes are aobut notes at large, its encapsulated you see, it makes sense. 

but whats the link with textland then?

## default
its like these fashion designer who only wear white tshirt and black pants., or htese graphic designer who have a simple portfolio, my books are on default mode. because the point is that their is so much empacted in the default already, my point is through the reading get to be amazed by these default, and the default status of the default 

## master question,

concerning the exhibition, what the status of the exhibition, regarding the project, and the audience, what stage choice underline this relation status 

## uncle yanco

its great, im an artist, even though there is an inherent fictional aspect of esverthing made for an audience, art, for oneself, design, for and audience, is inherently a tiny bit fictional, romanticizeds


a csertain relaiton to nowledge, and like, this idea that the materialisation of interest and questions through prokect are one things, but thhat everything is also more interwocven, and that it also appear before and after the first and last sentence, in what they eat and what teir hild ahhahakjh



## hardware
anyway, the wood goes around, or the hardware allow to articulate wood together, to say something, and litteraly articulate primitives shapes together, they are the grammar of the construction, the particules that articulate abstract words together, that underline their status, and give them direction, and meaning. thats why we can do some poetry with just some branches and some hardware. 

## glazing

it seems easy to uderstand than my prime source of ingo is not nature itself but mediated sources, and then, confroned to these sources I take them for objects long genealogy of how this came to be( but I should rather use the glazing method , look through them, to their object, and back and forth and finding what really matter and where to go next. If the book is about a garden, go there, if its about an aspect of this garden that can be find somewhere else, go somewhere else, if it is about how the author as an author see the garden, read more books about i, and if it is about how this athor see the gardenm ask the autho, not the book, not the garden. This is media-object glazing. merci sophie !
)

## zola

One should gather the most document possible about writters, penetrate their intimate life, know their fortune, establish their budget, follow them in their daily issues, and one should especially study the condition of the time&s bookshop, know how much a books made their writer earn, evaluate if litterary work was enough to feed its man. Only then we would understand the real causes of the litterary mind of this vanished society, because the soil explain the plant.

Obsidian Use Disorder (OUD)

Diagnostic Criteria:

A. A persistent pattern of problematic use of the note-taking app Obsidian, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by three (or more) of the following criteria, occurring within a 12-month period:

1. Tolerance: The individual requires increasing amounts of time using Obsidian to achieve the desired level of organization or productivity.
    
2. Withdrawal: When unable to access or utilize Obsidian, the individual experiences irritability, restlessness, or anxiety, which may be alleviated by obtaining access or engaging in Obsidian use.

# questions for amanda

what is the difference, gap, relation, between the scholars of mystic and the mystics ??
how to develop a peacefull relation with information overload, and the fear of loosing memory, loosing the self ?


the project is about reading and writting and take the stand that  they and how they are to face of the same coin, and try to bring them back to brought back to how they can be seen as  embodied technology to deal with chaos, to artiulate mumble knowldege out of chaos  and from this angle, trying to lay down a foundational publishing practive and find peacefull relation tochaos of  understanding and communication.

exploring the diversity of writting and reading practices. 

## checking

whwenever I talk, therefore to someone, when I talk to someone, i should remeber I am talking for someone, and therefore, look at them in the eyes, an check for their understanding, and be open to address questions. 



**deliberate repetition, forgetfulness, peace**
no assumption of importance, or that I can change something, ego and fear or losing this ego, my children are my brain, my biography, my project, for the future, it is a format, a book.

Contemporains des cathÃ©drales gothiques, les romans arthuriens en prose sont des fictions labyrinthiques, gÃ©nÃ©tiquement modifiÃ©es dâ€™un manuscrit Ã  lâ€™autre. Cycliques, ces fictions se dÃ©ploient en prenant modÃ¨le sur le vivant (forÃªts, branches, entrelacs), transformant romanciers et copistes en jardiniers dâ€™Ã©criture.

## post digital life of notes

what about my notes afet being scanned, now that I can replicate them. .. Is there still information that their digital copy dont get ? I guess there is a lot a chemistry that can be done, but from a counsicous point of view, the scane already can zoom in more than I can without tools when I am writting the notes. Is the nature or the date of the paper makes sense ? it can further contextualise the writing, but... what for, and same for the graphite, they are muji pen, 

## gas


My notebooks are usually quite messy, for the very reason that, my thought spread on the white paper frame like a gas in a jar. I will come back to it, write and overwrite, and fill the surface until it is homogeneously illegible, leveraging the 2 dimensions of the paper to make sure to obfuscate any articulated, structured path of anysort to guide the gaze. Thus making information retrieval virtually impossible and making for a very not engaging or articulated body of content, for whoever, myself included, 

offer to the the wanderer anything else than a mere block of homogeneous noise.

# listing everything dispisefull about lists


## fiction
I still cant believe that words can be anythiyng else thant fiction, that word can actually stand up from the page and means, and articulate, order and summon real life changes and behavior, over the distance of the reading. I from the television I read my text and say sit down, and thousands of listener instantly stop their activity and sit down, is it pure magic ? There is something. The question is why is it that I find this so unrealistic, soo improbable, as if they were tiny soldiers ready to fuck up, to stand up and ... they.... I think it is because I consider them as  inherently the realm of fiction and projection, and things that were and things that could be, they are the realm where everything that is not present become graspable, thoughtabke, articulable, and it is therefore really hard to see them as part of the world, they refer to things, they disappear, only poetry uses words for themselves, as the primary material of its craft in this they are magical as they summon and invoke. in minds, things that are not there, and minds can then act upon these dreams. language in this sense is a shiny pure raw potential, and the potential for all things, as of the borges library, that everything is writing

## the map

> "What a useful thing a pocket-map is!" I remarked.
> 
> "That's another thing we've learned from your Nation," said Mein Herr, "map-making. But we've carried it much further than you. What doÂ _you_Â consider theÂ _largest_Â map that would be really useful?"
> 
> "About six inches to the mile."
> 
> "OnlyÂ _six inches_!" exclaimed Mein Herr. "We very soon got to six yards to the mile. Then we tried aÂ _hundred_Â yards to the mile. And then came the grandest idea of allÂ ! We actually made a map of the country, on the scale of aÂ _mile to the mile_!"
> 
> "Have you used it much?" I enquired.
> 
> "It has never been spread out, yet," said Mein Herr: "the farmers objected: they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the sunlightÂ ! So we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well."

fromÂ [Lewis Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll "Lewis Carroll"),Â _[Sylvie and Bruno Concluded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvie_and_Bruno "Sylvie and Bruno"), Chapter XI, London, 1895_


"**On Exactitude in Science**" or "**On Rigor in Science**" (the originalÂ [Spanish-language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language")Â title is "Del rigor en la ciencia") is a one-paragraphÂ [short story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story "Short story")Â written in 1946 byÂ [Jorge Luis Borges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges "Jorge Luis Borges"), about theÂ [mapâ€“territory relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation "Mapâ€“territory relation"), written in the form of aÂ [literary forgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_forgery "Literary forgery").

## framing frame and labeling label contextualising context
as for a painting, there is a frame for each book, more or less explicitd depending on the edition, that situate the book in the world and history. as for a painting, there is contextualisation and meta information involved. as so far is the written name of the author part of the story ? when borges uses litterary forgery to change the name and provenance of the piece of text, it is because he knows that litterature is more than just the text, is in the eyes of the reader, and that changing the context and origin of the book, changes its perception, its reading perspective, therefore its meaning and experience, and all these ornement, and meta information of the book can be use as many narrative tools and strategies. 


# Organizational Studies - Science topic

Organizational studies is the examination of how individuals construct organizational structures, processes, and practices and how these, in turn, shape social relations and create institutions that ultimately influence people.

## mining text


It is a truism that 80 percent of business-relevant information originates inÂ [unstructured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data "Unstructured data")Â form, primarily text.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining#cite_note-breakthroughanalysis1-8)Â These techniques and processes discover and present knowledge â€“ facts,Â [business rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_rule "Business rule"), and relationships â€“ that is otherwise locked in textual form, impenetrable to automated processing.


## pitch deck. 
maybe i should write the story, structure, as a story, this process, of getting instreseted, and knowing its bad, to try to organise, but keeping doing so !!!lk 

## the wood of knowledge

different kind of wood, of furniture really, but wood is enough to make a change of paradigm, convey different relation to knowledge, or else, if looked at with the lens of what type of knowledge comes to you when looking at it, that it holds or offer, or come from, the answer is different. daark wood 19th century for me refer to maeterlinck, or guenon, or all the mysticismm of this period, in relation to colonialism actually, "opening up" to the west. it confers this analog secret that i cant really understand because of the distance, and the past is even more a fiction. 
light waxed plastified veneer wood feels like the knowledge is somewhere else, that it all happens somewhere else, and that this is just a facade of what could be learned, evenhtough it is the very first plae when the idea of a rebellion born, or get nipped in the bud. 

## what is the shape of an idea being formed

## and the idea of proto books. 

I developed during my study a gradual hate for art, i found artificial, more than pointless, inoffensive. the more I grow, and I see the bad design did, to the world and to me, it tool 4 years but I changed my mind. the idea  of reproducibility, and of delegat;ing, that push the creation back to the level of the plan, of the structure, and defused for me improvisation,a nd actually trial and error, which is supposed to be the base of design. because. 

new method to do :
- really lean approach, if the end horizon of the project, have an exhibition after week one. in general, its good to be done at the middle of the deadline, and reserve the other half to improvement. 
- base the projects in the material , from a technique or an object. its easier and funnier for me to go from the material to the conceptual and intelelctual than the other way around. 

## fiction
the past feels like a fiction. maybe because a fiction is not something that didnt happen, because in all the fictions of the world, at least written as such, im sure some did happen eventhough somewhere else with someone else. but a feeling of it being from the space usually attributed to fiction, such as films and words. or in general the told story, the refered to story ? 

there is actually a gradient, from which a serie of event is or not a fiction, or reality. sometime it is just perspective, the pov of someone on a 

it comes a lot to indirectedness maybe, that words refer to rather than are refered to, except in academia, and some example of modern litterature and poetry. but is there a poetry that is about the topic and not the form, the language ? 



## Meeting about meeting

for her project - it came to be during the meeting as well, not always formalised when it started, i think - klara have talk about people their project. For us it was a prime collaborator, kicking of the discussions of angeli, along marjanne my tutor. 

## embrace the schoolness, the freedom, the ungrounded, the artificial 

## klara's thoughts

`by being uncontrolled, by being uncontrollable, by not believing that I am in control. By believing that I'm not in control.`
are the words coming before or after the thoughts ?
can playing with grammar create new ideas or at least new material on which to reflect ? like chat gpt, random food for thought ?

I took me three readings, to understand the text, which means, whether, letting  go of assumption, feat, letting go the pickpocket gaze (who see pockets in god) (for me it takes the form of an ease for cronghe when it comes to being dramatic and emphatic styles, generaltities or artist bullshit)
3 times to let go of defensiveness, to fail the armor and giv up on the sword, to read through yourself, to get  this blank mind, to take the text seriously eventually, to open up entirely, to be vulnerable toward the text. 

`there id no other other than not knowing. There is no future without unknowing it, ther is no salvation unless it is in admitting that the harm  feel is somthing only I have the key to . And  th ekey tricks itself to look like a key of salvation`
Therepetition of words creates links, illusion or not of meaning, 
## para stories, infra stories

## it is a dangerous space of interpretation

## the autonomy of the text

this is firts tha abandon of the syle, of the interesti in the text  of the fetishisation of the form, and only then, the retake, understandin of the importance of the mediu,, the choice of the powerhold by text itself over its precision


its not about articulating the ideas, in an acadmia way, but exploring how one can embody idea, and navigate theory as in changin literal postiiton toward things when it comes to walk and see and hear and talk and do its about feeling the theory what it means on a bodya nd emotional level.  

like ideas are food and cues on a big map, if you forget them, you have still moved on the big map, and look around you from a different place

## the musician
this is maybe what  I am going for, , writting without being a writer, content over form. I use to be the servant of my ssentences, I tool the control back, but it is only o be confronted with the somtime opacoty of my own thoughts and body. and the dificulty faced while  trying to use anguage as the medium.

## time based medium

presentatio wise, language is a time based medium, like a video and is therefore diuclt to share in visual forms in this sense. 

## living along the system

I have my little infrastructure of words and paper, I write, read, transcribe, scan and print back and organise again, ditribute, transport the notes here and there, Im seen wth thm , i take picture wit them, I bring them to the restaurant, I fold themm in two and roll them in my pockets, and close to my body, I sweat notes, and my tears are many words, I throw sentences and my hands bath in a pond wood fibers and graphite and grammar and , I go to bed after working, and they are next to me, i woke up and in my brakfast they go along my tartines and . I wrap my brain around the space open by many words,  I fold my brain in between the line they drawm  , clamp my hands between the sheets, my gaze is absorbed in the pixels and the curves on my screen and my fingers dismantle to reach their attributed keys, and not letting distracted, and articulate with whats at hand. 

## systems systems

every system is excluatn by nature and the more its used and the more inconsistenies and fragilities and overlap, welaknesses, tnssion, inconsistenies are ok of ouse and a ssutem is only usfull to the extend tat it facilitate and foster , not when it limits an daunts. 


## wards' system
yesterday i could have followed ward's system of booklet, but it didn't com from me, an dI didn't feel like doing it, and so didn't and its better like that. 

lets embrace the non exhaustiveness of these systems as tiny jewels  you keep fo ryourselves, to built my tiny garden of personnal interests and unshared thought. 
Its easier for me now to know when to leave some stuff out ::)

## staging intelligence, the signs of it

Some of my friends, like paul, are smart, undeniably sbao, fluent in high level mathematics, dealing with abstraction verday, yet they don't have about it, and dont follow the liefestyle I would fantasize mself haing if I would to evolve in such env. THere is an aesthetic, as llifestyle I  have in mind, of the math researcher, alsi in the library, reading nie old books a charisma of searching the truth throufh knowledge and inspiration of passionate discussion etc,. that I don't see in them when 

there is commonly believed signs of intelligence, and the intelligence. it used to be seen as smart to speak slowly, see the wise man and serene old person, and now intelectuals in the radio, the more fast they speak the smarter they sounds. 

ami smart ?


## why books

maybe  so many people go for books because they are a leitimated format, wth and audienve already, close to what they would just otherwise, that having the time and differed attention to tell their story. 


I'm done with creating ensemble, settings, etx, Its a seductive mediu,, because of its systemisaion, autogenerative, and worldbuilding qualities (espacially the possibilty the enable to never really focus and include whatever you come accross a spend the smallest second working on ) that focus more on the structure and systems then apply and variegated. I got seduced because I haf a lot to cath up. I think, because it was a relevamt act of while sustem fucker and difficultui to focus . But now maybe because time expectation dimisnished, I&d rather focus on a single thing, of means, and shape but also of ideas, and like to recycle, reuse, and make variation of the same idea. 


I reached the limit og th epen and paper, now I did the exp, saw that O don't  draw so much, leant to type, and fox my printer , I ca go back to the omputer improve my digital toools, print stuff out , and let go. 

## next 
make a tiny word processor to write , and draw on top simultaneously, like the txt editor, but that wxpoer pdf maybe and .ppr for paper, the name of the app. 
but yet another tool
for understanding the tools. 

## not the same person, or let it sink

These are not the same words, those I wrtie now, than when I'll read them later. For how they re a functional tool, later, when I'de de forget from where they com from, and when I'll be in the position of "reading" ther will be different word, than when I read then directly after writting where the position toward them is different.
